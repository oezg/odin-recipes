        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a delicious meal for anyone who loves vegetables and celery in particular. It is also relatively easy to cook. You can cook the rice or potatoes the way you like them. I prefer to eat celery with potatoes.</p>
        <p>You can serve the celery with vegetables. My favorite vegetable to serve with celery is carrots. The orange color of carrot and the white color of the celery create a colorful dish. Combined with the yellow color of potatoes, this dish is not only tasty but also full of colors. </p>
