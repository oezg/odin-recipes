        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a delicious meal for anyone who loves meat and lamb in particular. It is also relatively easy to cook. You can cook the rice or potatoes the way you like them. I prefer to eat my lamb with quinoa.</p>
        <p>You can serve the lamb curry with vegetables. My favorite vegetable to serve with lamb curry is green beans. The color of green beans and the brown color of the lamb create a colorful dish. Combined with the yellow color of quinoa, this dish is not only tasty but also full of colors. </p>
