        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a delicious meal for anyone who loves fish and salmon in particular. It is also relatively easy to cook. You can cook the rice or potatoes the way you like them. I prefer to eat my salmon with Sp채tzle, a type of noodles specific to southwestern Germany.</p>
        <p>You can serve the salmon with vegetables. My favorite vegetable to serve with salmon is broccoli. The green color of broccoli and the rosa color of the salmon create a colorful dish. Combined with the yellow color of Sp채tzle or noodles, this dish is not only tasty but also full of colors. </p>
